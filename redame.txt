General description:
1) The app fetches the list of schools on start up, just the dbn, school name, and borough info.
Reason: there is only 440ish schools, the data rarely changes, so it makes sense to save it in local
db instead of fetching it from server everytime.

2) User can browse schools or view saved schools
3) Clicking start icon in the schools list or school detail page will save the school

Stuff to improve:

    Main fragment
    1) Upon successfully loading school data, save the timestamp in datastore. Everytime on app startup,
    check if x amount of time has passed, if so, re-fetch data again.

    School List fragment:
    1) Add search/filter function that allows user to search for school name and filter by boroughs
    2) If failed to fetch schools on app start, show network error info and give user a retry button

    School detail fragment:
    1) Code the ReadMoreTextView from scratch instead of using 3rd party library, it is not working well right now.
    2) Make the shared element transition better
    3) Handle net work error with better ui and logic

    General
    1) Add unit testing
    2) Add actual dependency injection
